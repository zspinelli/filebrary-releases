# filebrary-releases
Public releases of Filebrary for testing and distribution.

"ok but wtf is filebrary?" great question. it's supposed to be a tagging and searching system similar to hydrus network except it's intended to support any kind of file by using an internal homemade document-based database system. it also does/will support mutiple databases to assist in some semblence of customizable organization unlike hydrus which renames everything and dumps it all in it's own directory structure.

a snapshot of an earlier version of the python + pyqt6 version. i'll upload a picture of the new c++ version when i post a release of it.
